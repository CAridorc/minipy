                      minipy: a Python 2 minifier
                by Gareth Rees <http://garethrees.org/>


INTRODUCTION
------------

minipy is a minifier for Python 2. It rewrites Python 2 source code in a
way that preserves the meaning of the code while reducing it in
size. For example:

    $ cat fib.py
    cache = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2}
    def fibonacci(n):
        """Return the nth Fibonacci number."""
        if n not in cache:
            a = n // 2
            r = n % 2
            m = (r * 2) - 1
            cache[n] = fibonacci(a + 1) ** 2 + m * fibonacci(a + r - 1) ** 2
        return cache[n]

    $ minipy --rename --docstrings fib.py
    a={0:0,1:1,2:1,3:2}
    def b(c):
     if c not in a:d=c//2;e=c%2;f=e*2-1;a[c]=b(d+1)**2+f*b(d+e-1)**2
     return a[c]


COMMAND LINE
------------

Usage: minipy [options] [-o OUTPUT] FILE

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        output file (default: stdout)
  -D, --docstrings      remove docstrings (implies --noselftest)
  -R, --rename          aggressively rename non-preserved variables
  -i INDENT, --indent=INDENT
                        number of spaces per indentation level
  -p PRESERVE, --preserve=PRESERVE
                        preserve words from renaming (separate by commas)
  --nojoinlines         put each statement on its own line
  --noselftest          skip the self-test
  --debug               dump the parse tree


THE SELF-TEST
-------------

Generating minified source code without accidentally changing the
meaning is tricky: see the list of issues [1] for many awkward cases
that had to be fixed. Therefore, in its default operating mode, minipy
performs a “self-test”: it takes the minified code, re-parses it, and
asserts that the parse tree for the minified code is identical to the
parse tree for the original code. If the self-test passes, then you can
be highly confident that minipy has not changed the meaning of your
code.

In order to pass the self-test, minipy must eschew a few changes to the
code that result in harmless changes to the parse tree. These changes
are:

* Replacing “pass” with “0”.
* Replacing “-(1)” with “-1”.

You can use the --noselftest option to enable these changes, but by
disabling the self-test you accept a small risk of a bug in minipy
changing the meaning of your code.

The optional transformations --rename and --docstrings can’t be combined
with the self-test, so these options imply --noselftest.

Please report all self-test failures [2], attaching the code that causes
the failure.


RENAMING
--------

Python’s use of introspection and duck typing means that it is not
possible to change names in a program without risk of changing the
meaning. The --rename option to minipy therefore makes a “best attempt”
to discover names that need to be preserved, but does not guarantee
anything. Use at your own risk!

The following names are preserved when renaming:

* Names specified on the command-line via the --preserve option
  (write --preserve=name1,name2,name3 to preserve more than one name).
* Built-in names (abs, all, any, apply, ...).
* Any name used as an attribute (.join, .index, .copy, .sort, ...).
* Any name starting with two underscores.
* The names of all imported modules.
* Any name exported by a module in a “from module import *” statement.
* Any name in the list assigned to the __all__ global variable.
